Getting Started
Go to https://github.com/l1mk/photographer_workflow_database and click "clone or download" green button, select clone with SHH and in your command promp, type:
$git clone https://github.com/l1mk/photographer_workflow_database

After that make sure you are inside the new directory by using:
$cd photographer_workflow_database

Configuration
Dependencies and all configuration is done in environment.rb and config.ru. Database is stored in DB folder with all the migrations. Gemfile already has all the gems you will require so make sure you run:
$bundle install
(if you encounter an issue with fully running bundle install, due to thin version, try running this first $bundle update thin)
To have rake and shotgun installed, and from there, run all your migrations:
$rake db:migrate

This will create a schema with all tables for each class. After you are good to go, just run Shotgun:
$shotgun
And from the title "Your server is running at 192.xxx.xxx.xxx:xxxxx" copy that IP address to your browser, allowing you to see the app live from the browser.

The website give you the option to signup or sign in, and after following the instruction of any, it will take you to the welcome page, where you can see all your fellow photographers that have created an account, and all clients and sessions for all members of the website.

You can also visit an index of all clients, and all sessions independently. Look at your profile as a photographer where you can see all work you have done, and edit or delete your own profile.

Sessions and Clients can be created as well, and edited and delete by the person who created each.
